# Payment links

Payment links allow you to receive online payments from your users without integrating with the Pay.gov.au API. When a user accesses your payment link, theyâ€™ll be able to make an online card payment.

You may want to use payment links if your service:

- is non-digital and uses paper applications to process payments
- is non-digital and has low transaction volumes
- asks your users for payment by sending email or letters
- does not have a development team that can integrate your service with Pay.gov.au
